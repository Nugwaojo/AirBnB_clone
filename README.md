Description

This project is to build a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This is the first step towards building a full AirBnB clone web application.

Command Interpreter Description

The command interpreter is a simple text-based interface that allows you to manage AirBnB objects. You can use it to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects.

How to Start the Command Interpreter

To start the command interpreter, simply run the following command:

python console.py
How to Use the Command Interpreter

Once the command interpreter is running, you can type commands to manage AirBnB objects. For example, to create a new user, you would type the following command:

create user name="Isabel" email="Isabel@google.com"
To retrieve all users, you would type the following command:

list users
To update a user's name, you would type the following command:

update user id=1 name="John Doe"
To delete a user, you would type the following command:

delete user id=1
Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

# Create a new user
create user name="Isabel" email="Isabel@google.com"

# Retrieve all users
list users

# Update a user's name
update user id=1 name="John Doe"

# Delete a user
delete user id=1

# Create a new place
create place name="My Airbnb" address="123 Main Street" city="San Francisco" state="CA" zip="94105"

# Retrieve all places
list places

# Update a place's name
update place id=1 name="Margaret's Airbnb"

# Delete a place
delete place id=1
